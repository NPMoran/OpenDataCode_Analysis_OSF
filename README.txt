###Data and Code Readme for the project: "From Policy to Practice: Progress towards Data- and Code-Sharing in Ecology and Evolution"

###Lead Authors:
[redacted]


### Project Description ----

This study assesses the clarity, strictness, and timing of data- and code-sharing policies across 275 journals in ecology and evolutionary biology. This also analyses initial policy compliance using submission data from two journals: Proceedings of the Royal Society B and Ecology Letters.
