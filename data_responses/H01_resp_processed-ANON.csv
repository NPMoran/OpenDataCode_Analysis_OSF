For articles published in Ecography, it is required that authors deposit data supporting their accepted papers in public archives of their choice (see section on Data sharing and repositories below). Authors must confirm that they deposit their data in a public repository and indicate the repository of their choice.

---


As part of the NSO publishing policy, authors of Ecography are required to deposit the data supporting the results in the paper in an appropriate publicly accessible archive, such as e.g. Dryad, TreeBase, figshare, or other archive that guarantees preservation and provides a permanent identifier of the data (such as e.g. DOI-number or Genbank accession number). The permanent DOI-number from the archive identifier should be provided by the authors or the archive, after acceptance of the paper. Data should normally be made publicly available at the time of publication, but may be postponed for up to one year if the technology of the archive allows for it. Longer embargoes may be granted in exceptional cases after correspondence with the editorial office. Derived, summary data may also be archived. DNA sequences published in the NSO journals should be deposited in the EMBL/GenBank/DDJB Nucleotide Sequence Databases. An accession number for each sequence must be included in the manuscript. The ScholarOne submission system is integrated with Dryad and the journal will cover the data processing charge if the authors decide to deposit the data files there.

This journal encourages and enables you to share data that supports your research publication where appropriate, and enables you to interlink the data with your published articles. Research data refers to the results of observations or experimentation that validate research findings, which may also include software, code, models, algorithms, protocols, methods and other useful materials related to the project.
Below are a number of ways in which you can associate data with your article or make a statement about the availability of your data when submitting your manuscript. If you are sharing data in one of these ways, you are encouraged to cite the data in your manuscript and reference list. Please refer to the ""References"" section for more information about data citation. For more information on depositing, sharing and using research data and other relevant research materials, visit the research data page.

Data linking 
If you have made your research data available in a data repository, you can link your article directly to the dataset. Elsevier collaborates with a number of repositories to link articles on ScienceDirect with relevant repositories, giving readers access to underlying data that gives them a better understanding of the research described.
There are different ways to link your datasets to your article. When available, you can directly link your dataset to your article by providing the relevant information in the submission system. For more information, visit the database linking page.

For supported data repositories a repository banner will automatically appear next to your published article on ScienceDirect.

In addition, you can link to relevant data or entities through identifiers within the text of your manuscript, using the following format: Database: xxxx (e.g., TAIR: AT1G01020; CCDC: 734053; PDB: 1XFN).

Data statement 
To foster transparency, we encourage you to state the availability of your data in your submission. This may be a requirement of your funding body or institution. If your data is unavailable to access or unsuitable to post, you will have the opportunity to indicate why during the submission process, for example by stating that the research data is confidential.

All authors are required to make code for simulations, new applications and non-standard analyses freely available upon acceptance so that analyses are reproducible (see below).

The overarching objective of our policy is to ensure that high quality code is readily available to our readers, ideally open source. The key principles we intend our policy to ensure are Quality, Usability, Accessibility and Functionality. More specifically:

Quality: Where code is the primary research output this code will be peer reviewed so that readers and users have confidence in the high standards of code preparation. By necessity this cannot include extensive testing, but reviewers will look for evidence of good coding practice.

Usability: Code needs to be usable, so that readers are able to implement methods readily. This includes both the implementation and the platform. We discourage the use of proprietary software in favour of software that respects established standards for software freedom (e.g. https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html), except when open software is unavailable. The implementation should include documentation and examples with benchmarking data where possible.

Accessibility: We require a version of record. This should be the exact version of the code described in the journal and able to replicate all results presented. However, we recognise that code evolves and encourage the use of platforms that permit updating with version control.

Functionality: Functionality needs to be novel and add to what is already available.

We recognise that our primary purpose and capability is to ensure rigorous peer review and the integrity of the publication process. However, as part of the British Ecological Society we have an objective to communicate ecological science. The above principles are intended to ensure that the community is benefitting from well-communicated outputs that are accessible, as well as being designed to promote good research practice in the community.",2,https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/hub/editorial-policies#archiving,

Open Research Badges

To recognize author efforts toward open science, Conservation Biology offers authors of accepted papers the following three open research badges: open materials, open data, and preregistration. The corresponding (or submitting) author is awarded badges. Materials pertinent to the type of badge must be posted in a publicly accessible format to a qualifying repository, for example, The Open Science Framework, Figshare (http://figshare.com), and Dataverse (http://dataverse.org). Other repositories are listed on the Registry of Research Data Repositories (http://www.re3data.org).


Open materials: research instruments and materials  of sufficient detail for researchers to be able reproduce procedures and analyses.


Open data: data and sufficient metadata to allow researchers to check that study results are reproducible.  In cases in which data cannot be made public (e.g., locations of rare and threatened species, personal information on human participants, and confidentially agreements with funders ), authors may provide an explanation of such circumstances in the alternative note section of the disclosure form. The explanation is included in the articleâs open research note.


Preregistration: research design and data analyses plans registered prior to implementation.


For all badges, authors must submit in ScholarOne an Open Research disclosure form, a link to which is provided in ScholarOne. One should be able to open the link from the pdf form or copy the link (i.e., the link cannot be in picture format).",3,https://conbio.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/hub/journal/15231739/homepage/forauthors.html?utm_source=google&utm_medium=paidsearch&utm_campaign=R3MR425&utm_content=LifeSciences&gclid=Cj0KCQjw4bipBhCyARIsAFsieCy4Eou38zVbopqN0oE5MHTvWC9G8_Bn7caA5nu2ktrL11hG8zL-eDAaAqhiEALw_wcB,"Perhaps there could be another option for the question 'How strict is this policy?' = ""Incentivised"".

journalâs Research data policy. We encourage research data to be archived in data repositories wherever possible. SPRINGER Research data policy:

At Springer Nature we advance discovery by publishing trusted research, supporting the development of new ideas and championing open science. We also aim to facilitate compliance with research funder and institution requirements to share data.

To help accomplish this we have established a standard research data policy for our journals, based on transparency around supporting data. This policy applies to all datasets that are necessary to interpret and replicate the conclusions reported in a research article.
1. All original articles must include a data availability statement

Data availability statements should include information on what data are available, where these can be found, and any applicable access terms. This applies to both original and reused data, and whether or not data can be shared publicly. See our guidance on data availability statements for more information.
2. We strongly encourage that all datasets supporting the analysis and conclusions of the paper are made publicly available at the time of publication, and we mandate the sharing of community-endorsed data types

We encourage authors to deposit their supporting data in publicly available repositories, or failing this within the manuscript or additional supporting files. See our repository guidance for more information.

For a number of data types, submission to a community-endorsed, public repository is mandatory. See our list of mandated data types.
3. Peer reviewers are entitled to request access to underlying data (and code) when needed to perform their evaluation of a manuscript.
4. We recognise it is not always possible to share research data publicly, for instance when privacy of research participants could be compromised. In such instances data availability should still be stated in the manuscript along with any conditions for access.

A large number of our journals already support this policy, including Nature Portfolio, BMC and many Springer and Palgrave titles. We are in the process of implementing this policy across the remainder of our portfolio in stages.

For information on a journalâs specific policies, please consult the journal submission guidelines.

Research Data Policy and Data Availability Statements
This journal operates a type 2 research data policy (life sciences).

The journal strongly encourages that all datasets on which the conclusions of the paper rely should be available to readers. We encourage authors to ensure that their datasets are either deposited in publicly available repositories (where available and appropriate) or presented in the main manuscript or additional supporting files whenever possible. Please see Springer Natureâs information on recommended repositories.

List of Repositories

Research Data Policy

General repositories - for all types of research data - such as figshare and Dryad may be used where appropriate.

Datasets that are assigned digital object identifiers (DOIs) by a data repository may be cited in the reference list. Data citations should include the minimum information recommended by DataCite: authors, title, publisher (repository name), identifier.

DataCite

Where a widely established research community expectation for data archiving in public repositories exists, submission to a community-endorsed, public repository is mandatory. Persistent identifiers (such as DOIs and accession numbers) for relevant datasets must be provided in the paper.

If the journal that youâre submitting to uses double-blind peer review and you are providing reviewers with access to your data (for example via a repository link, supplementary information or data on request), it is strongly suggested that the authorship in the data is also blinded. There are data repositories that can assist with this and/or will create a link to mask the authorship of your data.

For the following types of data set, submission to a community-endorsed, public repository is mandatory:

Mandatory deposition	Suitable repositories
Protein sequences	Uniprot
DNA and RNA sequences	Genbank
DNA DataBank of Japan (DDBJ)

EMBL Nucleotide Sequence Database (ENA)

DNA and RNA sequencing data	NCBI Trace Archive
NCBI Sequence Read Archive (SRA)

Genetic polymorphisms	dbSNP
dbVar

European Variation Archive (EVA)

Linked genotype and phenotype data	dbGAP
The European Genome-phenome Archive (EGA)

Macromolecular structure	Worldwide Protein Data Bank (wwPDB)

Research Data Policy Frequently Asked Questions

Data availability
The journal encourages authors to provide a statement of Data availability in their article. Data availability statements should include information on where data supporting the results reported in the article can be found, including, where applicable, hyperlinks to publicly archived datasets analysed or generated during the study. Data availability statements can also indicate whether data are available on request from the authors and where no data are available, if appropriate.

Data Availability statements can take one of the following forms (or a combination of more than one if required for multiple datasets):

1. The datasets generated during and/or analysed during the current study are available in the [NAME] repository, [PERSISTENT WEB LINK TO DATASETS]
2. The datasets generated during and/or analysed during the current study are not publicly available due [REASON WHY DATA ARE NOT PUBLIC] but are available from the corresponding author on reasonable request.
3. The datasets generated during and/or analysed during the current study are available from the corresponding author on reasonable request.
4. Data sharing not applicable to this article as no datasets were generated or analysed during the current study.
5. All data generated or analysed during this study are included in this published article [and its supplementary information files].
More examples of template data availability statements, which include examples of openly available and restricted access datasets, are available:

From https://www.springernature.com/gp/authors/research-data-policy/data-policy-faqs (which is linked to from the journal site):

Do I have to share my data when submitting to a Springer Nature journal?

We strongly encourage that all research data are made available to readers without undue restrictions. For some types of data, submission to a community-endorsed, public repository is mandatory. See our guidance on mandatory data deposition for more information. 

We recognise that some data, such as data about identifiable human research participants, cannot be shared openly. Where data cannot be shared, an adequate reason should be provided in the Data Availability Statement.

Reviewers and editors may request access to datasets that are not publicly available.

When should I share my data?

Authors are strongly encouraged to make supporting data available as early as possible while respecting research community norms and funder and institution policies. Researchers generally have a right of reasonable first use to data generated during their research. 

Many repositories offer functionality to deposit datasets without making them immediately publicly available. Researchers therefore have the option to deposit data prior to submission of their manuscript, even if they do not want to make their data available until their manuscript is accepted or published. However, reviewers and editors may request access to datasets before this point.

Summary of requirements
The above should be summarized in a statement and placed in a âDeclarationsâ section before the reference list under a heading of âFundingâ and/or âCompeting interestsâ. Other declarations include Ethics approval, Consent, Data, Material and/or Code availability and Authorsâ contribution statements.

Please see the various examples of wording below and revise/customize the sample statements according to your own needs.

When all authors have the same (or no) conflicts and/or funding it is sufficient to use one blanket statement.

Do I have to share my code or other materials in order to publish in a Springer Nature journal?

The focus of this policy framework is on data rather than software but the sharing of software alongside data is also important to support reproducibility and transparency. Many Springer Nature journals also support the use of Code Availability Statements. Please consult the journalâs submission guidance or contact the journal directly for information on code sharing and code availability.",1,https://www.springer.com/journal/42974/submission-guidelines#Instructions%20for%20Authors_Research%20Data%20Policy%20and%20Data%20Availability%20Statements,So unclear!!

10/17/2023 20:42:49,[redacted],[redacted],ecology letters,During Peer Review,Mandated,"Data and code are important products of scientific enterprise, and they must be preserved and remain accessible in future decades.

For manuscripts that depend on new or existing data, and/or on code written by the authors, Ecology Letters requires that this material be supplied and accessible to editors and reviewers at the time of submission. This means that prior to submission, you will need to prepare your raw data (or the subset of existing data that was used), metadata, code and derived data products, archive this material in an external repository that subject editors and reviewers can access, and include a clear README file that will ensure accessibility and readability. This will allow us to properly assess your work and confirm that the archive is complete and usable. See below for more details on the requirements.

Ecology Letters requires that the raw data (or subset of existing data) used to generate the results in the paper are archived in one of the following public repositories: Dryad, Figshare, Hal, Zenodo, OSF, US federal agencies repositories, or Environmental Data Initiative (EDI). Data should not be uploaded alongside your submission as a supporting document. In order to ensure data can be reusable, it is necessary to upload (1) the data files that were analysed to produce the statistics and figures reported in the paper, (2) a metadata file explaining what the data are in each column and what rows represent. The metadata should record the units of measurement and a verbal description in English of the data included in each column. Dryad also publishes a list of best practices (https://datadryad.org/stash/best_practices) that Ecology Letters endorses.

Computer code used to produce the figures and conduct analyses or simulations must also be archived in a public repository (e.g., Zenodo, Figshare). Code should not be uploaded with your submission as a supporting document. All code must be annotated so readers can understand what each segment or function does. If figures have been generated in a program such as Excel, the Excel file including the figure and the data must be archived. Further guidance is available at https://authorservices.wiley.com/author-resources/Journal-Authors/open-access/data-sharing-citation/index.html. 

If the raw data used for a study are already deposited online in a different repository (excluding business-owned and single-university repositories) with a separate DOI, this can be cited. However, often data sources used from an already published dataset are quite different than the original, using different subsets of the data and manipulating it in different ways. In such cases, we request that authors of Ecology Letters papers follow best practices for open science and provide code (preferably in R) that is able to access the cited DOI, retrieve the raw data used for the study, and manipulate it into the form used for analyses. This data accessing code must be combined with the code used for analyses, and deposited in the same repository.

DNA sequences published in Ecology Letters must be deposited in the EMBL/GenBank/DDJB Nucleotide Sequence Databases. An accession number for each sequence must be included in the manuscript.

Exceptions may be granted at the discretion of the Editor-in-Chief for sensitive information such as human subject data or the location of endangered species. An embargo of up to one year is permitted. Requests for longer periods will be rejected. At the time of submission, authors must use the private-for-peer-review option provided by data repositories.

Authors are required to complete a data accessibility statement for all papers, confirming that each of these actions has been undertaken. The statement, as well as data and code DOI, must be provided at initial submission. Editors will screen some of the data submitted. If at a later date it is found that authors of published papers have not adhered to these strict guidelines, the paper will be retracted by the editors and a statement made in the journal justifying this action.",5,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/page/journal/14610248/homepage/forauthors.html#tips20,,During Peer Review,Mandated,"Data and code are important products of scientific enterprise, and they must be preserved and remain accessible in future decades.

Scientific Reports follows the Nature Portfolio policies for the sharing of research materials. Read these policies in full here.

Supporting data must be made available to Editorial Board Members and referees at the time of submission for the purposes of evaluating the manuscript. Referees may be asked to comment on the terms of access to materials, methods and/or data sets; Scientific Reports reserves the right to refuse publication in cases where authors do not provide adequate assurances that they can comply with the publication's requirements for sharing materials.

A submission to the journal implies that materials described in the manuscript, including all relevant raw data, will be freely available to any researcher wishing to use them for non-commercial purposes, without breaching participant confidentiality. The journal strongly encourages that all datasets on which the conclusions of the paper rely should be available to readers. We encourage authors to ensure that their datasets are either deposited in publicly available repositories (where available and appropriate) or presented in the main manuscript or additional supporting files whenever possible.

All original articles must include a Data availability statement. Data availability statements should include information on where data supporting the results reported in the article can be found including, where applicable, hyperlinks to publicly archived datasets analysed or generated during the study. By data we mean the minimal dataset that would be necessary to interpret, replicate and build upon the findings reported in the article. We recognise it is not always possible to share research data publicly, for instance when individual privacy could be compromised, and in such instances data availability should still be stated in the manuscript along with any conditions for access.

After publication, readers who encounter refusal by the authors to comply with these policies should contact the Scientific Reports publishing team. In cases where we are unable to resolve a complaint, the matter may be referred to the authors' funding institution and/or a formal statement of correction may be published, attached online to the publication, stating that readers have been unable to obtain necessary materials to replicate the findings.

Details about how to share some specific materials, data and methods can be found in the sections below. The preferred way to share large datasets is via public repositories. Some of these repositories offer authors the option to host data associated with a manuscript confidentially and provide anonymous access to referees before public release. These repositories coordinate the public release of the data with the journal's publication date. This option should be used when possible, but it is the authors' responsibility to communicate with the repository to ensure that public release is made promptly on the publication date. Any supporting datasets for which there is no public repository must be made available as Supplementary Information files that will be freely accessible on nature.com upon publication. In cases where it is technically impossible for such files to be provided to the journal, the authors must make the data available to Editorial Board Members and referees at submission, and directly upon request to any reader on and after the publication date, the authors providing a URL or other unique identifier in the manuscript.",4,https://www.nature.com/srep/journal-policies/editorial-policies#availability,"Data sharing is mandatory to Editor and Reviewers, BUT after that is only ENCOURAGED",Unclear,On Reviewer Request,"Availability of computer code and algorithm

For all studies using custom code or mathematical algorithm that is central to the conclusions, authors must provide any previously unreported custom computer code or algorithm used to generate results upon editor or reviewer request.

Communications Biology requires a Data Availability Statement to be included in the submitted manuscript (see the section on availability of materials and data in our editorial policies page for more information). 

An inherent principle of publication is that others should be able to replicate and build upon the authors' published claims. Please note that all published manuscripts reporting original research in Nature Portfolio journals must include a data availability statement. The data availability statement must make the conditions of access to the âminimum datasetâ that are necessary to interpret, verify and extend the research in the article, transparent to readers. This statement must be submitted with your manuscript. Please see the full policy for more information. Authors who need help understanding our data sharing policies, help finding a suitable data repository, or help organizing and sharing research data can access Springer Natureâs Author Support portal for additional guidance.

Any previously unreported custom computer code used to generate results reported in the manuscript that are central to the main claims must be made available to editors and referees upon request. Any practical issues preventing code sharing will be evaluated by the editors who reserve the right to decline the manuscript if important code is unavailable. At publication, Nature Portfolio journals consider it best practice to release custom computer code in a way that allows readers to repeat the published results. Where availability of custom computer code is deemed to be central to our editorial interest in the paper and the readerâs ability to make use of and reproduce the work, we may decline to review or publish the manuscript if authors indicate that they would be unable to release the computer code upon publication.

For all studies using custom code that is deemed central to the conclusions, a statement must be included in the Methods section, under the heading ""Code availability"", indicating whether and how the code can be accessed, including any restrictions. See the section on Availability and peer review of computer code in our Editorial Policies for more information.

An open research policy provides full transparency for scientific data and code, facilitates replication and synthesis, and aligns ESA journals with current standards. As of 1 February 2021, all new manuscript submissions to ESA journals must abide by the following policy.

As a condition for publication in ESA journals, all underlying data and novel statistical code pertinent to the results presented in the publication must be made available in a permanent, publicly accessible data archive or repository upon acceptance of a manuscript, with rare exceptions (see the âDetailsâ tab for more information). Archived data and novel statistical code should be sufficiently complete to allow replication of tables, graphs, and statistical analyses reported in the original publication, and perform new or meta-analyses. As such, the desire of authors to control additional research with these data and/or code shall not be grounds for withholding material.

Thus, for the purpose of this policy, the following underlying material is required:

Raw data and metadata used to generate tables, figures, plots, videos/animations
Novel code or computer software utilized to generate results or analyses
All methods or protocols utilized to generate the data, both existing (including references) and new methods/protocols
Derived data products // Raw data, metadata, and derived data products must be provided in an appropriate external archive if a manuscript is accepted. At the submission stage for most ESA manuscript types and journals (see the exceptions above), data should not be uploaded alongside your submission in the file list. Authors are not required to provide data at the submission stage, but it is strongly encouraged that authors deposit data in an external repository prior to manuscript submission to allow Subject-matter Editors and reviewers access. Many repositories now offer a private-for-peer-review option and we strongly encourage authors to use this approach.

Novel code must be supplied as private-for-peer review in an external repository during the review process. At the submission stage, code should not be uploaded with your submission in the file list. // In addition to our requirements for the presentation and archival of data and novel code, restrictions on the inclusion and formatting of specific pieces of supporting information are now in effect. The following items can only be made available as part of our Open Research Policy and cannot be included with a submission in the file list:

1) Spreadsheets (.xlsx, .csv, etc.)
2) Large tables

If the above items are included with your submission, your manuscript will be returned to you to ensure it follows our Open Research policy guidelines.

For a definition of a âlarge tableâ please see âHow do I know if my table is allowed as supporting information?â in our FAQ section.

After Acceptance
Following manuscript acceptance, complete data and novel code must be registered in a repository to be made available at the time of publication. ESA Publications staff will verify data and code archiving is complete before releasing files to the publisher. By depositing data and code prior to publication of a manuscript, a permanent link and formal citation can be included in the published paper.

Data availability policy
All datasets used in the research for the manuscript must be made available to reviewers unless the data are already published elsewhere. Datasets also must be clearly described in the manuscript in the Data Availability Statement (see below).

For manuscripts involving phylogenetic analyses, electronic copies of data sets (e.g. nucleotide sequence data and new alignments of previously published data), in nexus format, must be supplied. Data files should also be provided for morphological analyses. Nucleotide/amino acid sequence data must be submitted to GenBank or EMBL. Genomic data can be submitted to NCBI Bioproject. Morphological data must be submitted to either Morphbank or MorphoBank. In all cases, data accession numbers must be provided in the text. 

Alternative arrangements may be made for very large data files associated with studies using simulations.

Data deposit process
At the time of submission, authors will be provided with a provisional Dryad link, which will allow editors and reviewers to access the online-only material but will not be made public. At the time of acceptance, a permanent Dryad link will be provided, allowing all every reader to access the data. Please ensure that the link is active. The first time you mention your dataset in the text of your paper, provide the DOI provided by Dryad as the location where the material can be found: either i) the provisional link during the different stages of the peer-review process, or ii) the permanent link once the paper is accepted and goes into production.

You may further choose to provide Supplementary Material with your article files, which will be available for download directly from your article page. Guidance on preparing and labeling these files is available on Oxford Academic's Preparing and submitting your manuscript webpage.

Check over your Online Appendices or Supplemental Material (if any) carefully, because they will not be copyedited or proofread, and cannot be changed later.

Data Availability Statement
The inclusion of a Data Availability Statement is a requirement for articles published in Systematic Biology. Data Availability Statements provide a standardised format for readers to understand the availability of data underlying the research results described in the article. The statement may refer to original data generated in the course of the study or to third-party data analysed in the article. The statement should be written as its own section, after the Discussion or Conclusions, and before the Acknowledgements. The Data Availability Statement should describe and provide means of access, where possible, by linking to the data or providing the required unique identifier, for example:

Data files and/or online-only appendices can be found in the Dryad data repository: http://dx.doi.org/10.5061/dryad.[NNNN]

Systematic Entomology mandates data sharing. Review Wileyâs Data Sharing policy where you will be able to see and select the data availability statement that is right for your submission.

Systematic Entomology requires you to archive all the data from which your published results are derived in a public repository. Tree files, morphological and molecular matrices and other relevant data should be deposited in any one of the established repositories such as TreeBASE, Dryad, Zenodo etc. Smaller morphological matrices can also be included in the supplement. If your paper reports novel genetic sequences, please include the GenBank and/or NCBI SRA accession numbers or BioProject number in your data availability statement.  Only uploading raw sequencing read data on Dryad or similar is not acceptable.

Please add any DOIs to file repositories as well as any accession numbers to the Data Availability Statement after the Discussion, and make sure this statement is identical to the one that is uploaded separately in the online submission form.

The repository that you choose should offer you guaranteed preservation (see the registry of research data repositories at https://www.re3data.org/) and should help you make it findable, accessible, interoperable, and re-useable, according to FAIR Data Principles (https://www.force11.org/group/fairgroup/fairprinciples).

All accepted manuscripts are required to publish a data availability statement to confirm the presence or absence of shared data. If you have shared data, this statement will describe how the data can be accessed, and include a persistent identifier (e.g., a DOI for the data, or an accession number) from the repository where you shared the data. Authors will be required to confirm adherence to the policy.  If you cannot share the data described in your manuscript, for example for legal or ethical reasons, then you must provide the appropriate data availability statement. Systematic Entomology notes that FAIR data sharing allows for access to shared data under restrictions (e.g., to protect confidential or proprietary information) but notes that the FAIR principles encourage you to share data in ways that are as open as possible (but that can be as closed as necessary).

Sample data availability statements are available here.  If published, all statements will be placed at the end of your manuscript.

Research data includes a wide range of types, including spreadsheets, images, textual extracts, archival documents, video or audio, interview notes or any specialist formats generated during research.

Data availability statements
All original research must include a data availability statement. This statement should explain how to access data supporting the results and analysis in the article, including links/citations to publicly archived datasets analysed or generated during the study. Please see our full policy here.

If it is not possible to share research data publicly, for instance when individual privacy could be compromised, this statement should describe how data can be accessed and any conditions for reuse. Participant consent should be obtained and documented prior to data collection. See our guidance on sensitive data for more information.

When creating a data availability statement, authors are encouraged to consider the minimal dataset that would be necessary to interpret, replicate and build upon the findings reported in the article.

Behavioral Ecology recognises that data are important components of scientific reporting and that they must be archived for future generations. A condition of publication in the journal is that authors deposit their data in a permanent, secure, public repository. Behavioral Ecology will provide data deposition in Dryad at no charge. Alternative, equivalent repositories may be considered by the Editor-in-Chief. Data will not be required for the review process. However, once a decision on publication has been reached authors will be sent a link and requested to upload their data. When preparing their data for uploading to Dryad, authors must follow the best practice guidelines outlined in Whitlock, M. C. 2011. Data archiving in ecology and evolution: best practices. Trends in Ecology and Evolution 26: 61-65. All analyses reported in an article must be repeatable using the archived data. Articles will proceed to publication only when data have been uploaded and a DOI provided. A ""Data Availability"" section must be included after the Acknowledgements section in the final version of the manuscript, and should read ""Analyses reported in this article can be reproduced using the data provided by Author (2016)."" The data should appear within the reference list as follows:

Author, GH, Author IJ. 2016. Data from: Title of original article. Behavioral Ecology. http://link to data.

Behavioral Ecology recognizes that in some cases authors may need to embargo public release of data for a period following publication. Behavioral Ecology will respect a 12 month embargo on publicly archived data should it be required, and on consultation with the Editor-in-Chief will consider periods of embargo longer than 12 months provided that a fully detailed and justified data release plan is reported under the Data Availability section. We also recognise that some qualitative details may be highly sensitive, such as the locality of IUCN Red Listed species, and will not mandate the release of such information.

Behavioral Ecology promotes ethical re-use of data, requiring that re-users cite both the source of data as well as the original paper for which those data were generated. Moreover, along with the submission of any manuscript to Behavioral Ecology that relies on archived data, authors will be asked to provide a copy of correspondences between the original data collector and the re-user that makes it clear that both parties have agreed to the data re-use and that issues surrounding co-authorship have been fully discussed and resolved to the satisfaction of data collector and re-user.",5,https://academic.oup.com/beheco/pages/information_for_authors,,Unclear,Encouraged,"Availability of Data and Materials

As a Cell Press author, you must be willing to share all of the data and original code you report in your published paper with the research community unless there is a countervailing legal or ethical prohibition (e.g., the data are confidential medical records). Your paper must include a comprehensive and accurate âdata and code availabilityâ statement that describes the steps you have taken or will take to make your data and original code available after publication. We strongly recommend that you archive all of the unprocessed data and original code that your paper reports in an online repository that meets the criteria for digital longevity, implementation of FAIR standards, and community support as articulated by Fairsharing.org and collaborators. Note that should issues arise after publication, failing to produce your data can be grounds for retraction.

Cell Press has specific requirements for datatypes that have community-endorsed, datatype-specific repositories. We call these datatypes âstandardized datatypes.â Examples of standardized datatypes include -seq, proteomics, and crystallography. A list of datatypes considered standardized under Cell Press policy is available here. A list of datatype-specific repositories that have been recommended by Cell Press is available here.

This authorâs guide describes how standardized datasets and original code accompany Cell Press manuscripts from submission through publication. Please note that it illustrates general practices; editors will provide guidance about specific cases. Exceptions to these requirements can be made for individual datasets when sharing data is legally or ethically prohibited. These cases should be discussed with editors as early as possible, ideally upon submission. 

Requirements for publication
All datasets that are composed of standardized datatypes and reported in Cell Press papers must be deposited in a datatype-specific, Cell-Press-recommended repository before a paper is accepted for publication. The datasetsâ accession number(s) or unique, permanent identifier(s) must be reported in the published paper. Any embargo must be lifted by the paperâs publication date, and the deposited datasets must be publicly accessible unless there is a countervailing legal or ethical prohibition. Note that if standardized datasets cannot be made accessible, editors might require that summary statistics (e.g., genomic summary results) or non-identifiable, post-processed versions of the data be deposited and shared.

All other datatypes must either be deposited in a general-purpose repository and publicly accessible as of the paperâs publication date or be shared by the lead contact upon request after publication. A list of general-purpose repositories that are recommended by Cell Press is available here.

Research Data Policy and Data Availability Statements
This journal follows Springer Nature research data policy. Sharing of all relevant research data is strongly encouraged and authors must add a Data Availability Statement to original research articles.

Research data includes a wide range of types, including spreadsheets, images, textual extracts, archival documents, video or audio, interview notes or any specialist formats generated during research.

Data availability statements
All original research must include a data availability statement. This statement should explain how to access data supporting the results and analysis in the article, including links/citations to publicly archived datasets analysed or generated during the study. Please see our full policy here.

If it is not possible to share research data publicly, for instance when individual privacy could be compromised, this statement should describe how data can be accessed and any conditions for reuse. Participant consent should be obtained and documented prior to data collection. See our guidance on sensitive data for more information.

When creating a data availability statement, authors are encouraged to consider the minimal dataset that would be necessary to interpret, replicate and build upon the findings reported in the article.

Further guidance on writing a data availability statement, including examples, is available at:

Data availability statements

Data repositories
Authors are strongly encouraged to deposit their supporting data in a publicly available repository. Sharing your data in a repository promotes the integrity, discovery and reuse of your research, making it easier for the research community to build on and credit your work.

See our data repository guidance for information on finding a suitable repository.

We recommend the use of discipline-specific repositories where available. For a number of data types, submission to specific public repositories is mandatory.

See our list of mandated data types.

The journal encourages making research data available under open licences that permit reuse. The journal does not enforce use of particular licences in third party repositories. You should ensure you have necessary rights to share any data that you deposit in a repository.

Research data policy

At Springer Nature we advance discovery by publishing trusted research, supporting the development of new ideas and championing open science. We also aim to facilitate compliance with research funder and institution requirements to share data.

To help accomplish this we have established a standard research data policy for our journals, based on transparency around supporting data. This policy applies to all datasets that are necessary to interpret and replicate the conclusions reported in a research article.

1. All original articles must include a data availability statement

Data availability statements should include information on what data are available, where these can be found, and any applicable access terms. This applies to both original and reused data, and whether or not data can be shared publicly. See our guidance on data availability statements for more information.

2. We strongly encourage that all datasets supporting the analysis and conclusions of the paper are made publicly available at the time of publication, and we mandate the sharing of community-endorsed data types

We encourage authors to deposit their supporting data in publicly available repositories, or failing this within the manuscript or additional supporting files. See our repository guidance for more information.

For a number of data types, submission to a community-endorsed, public repository is mandatory. See our list of mandated data types.

3. Peer reviewers are entitled to request access to underlying data (and code) when needed to perform their evaluation of a manuscript.

4. We recognise it is not always possible to share research data publicly, for instance when privacy of research participants could be compromised. In such instances data availability should still be stated in the manuscript along with any conditions for access.

A large number of our journals already support this policy, including Nature Portfolio, BMC and many Springer and Palgrave titles. We are in the process of implementing this policy across the remainder of our portfolio in stages.

For information on a journalâs specific policies, please consult the journal submission guidelines.

All authors are requested to make sure that all data and materials as well as software application or custom code support their published claims and comply with field standards. Please note that journals may have individual policies on (sharing) research data in concordance with disciplinary norms and expectations.

We encourage all authors of articles published in MDPI journals to share their research data. Individual journal guidelines can be found at the journal âInstructions for Authorsâ page. Data sharing policies concern the minimal dataset that supports the central findings of a published study. Generated data should be publicly available and cited in accordance with journal guidelines.

MDPI data policies are informed by TOP Guidelines and FAIR Principles.

Where ethical, legal or privacy issues are present, data should not be shared. The authors should make any limitations clear in the Data Availability Statement upon submission.

Evolution requires all authors, where ethically possible, to publicly release all data and software code underlying any published paper as a condition of publication. Authors are required to include a data availability statement in their article. When data and software underlying the research article are available in an online source, authors should include a full citation in their reference list. For details of the minimum information to be included in data and software citations see the OUP guidance on citing research data and software.

Wherever possible, data should be presented in the main manuscript, included as supplementary material, or deposited in a public repository. Information on general repositories for all data types, and a list of recommended repositories by subject area, is available on the OUP Research data page.

Authors may request an exception to the policy due to legal, privacy, ethical, or other limitations or restrictions. Exceptions will be made at the discretion of the Journal. Please notify the editorial office when submitting your manuscript if you wish to request an exception. If an exception is granted, a data availability statement must still be included in your paper specifying what cannot be shared and explaining why.

Data availability statement
The inclusion of a data availability statement is a requirement for articles published in Evolution. Data availability statements provide a standardized format for readers to understand the availability of original and third-party data underlying the research results described in the article. The statement should describe and provide means of access, where possible, by linking to the data or providing the required unique identifier.

The data availability statement should be included on the title page of your article under the heading âData availabilityâ.

More information and examples of data availability statements can be found here.

Data citation
Evolution supports the Force 11 Data Citation Principles and requires that all publicly available datasets be fully referenced in the reference list with an accession number or unique identifier such as a digital object identifier (DOI). Data citations should include the minimum information recommended by DataCite:

[dataset]* Authors, Year, Title, Publisher (repository or archive name), Identifier

*The inclusion of the [dataset] tag at the beginning of the citation helps us to correctly identify and tag the citation. This tag will be removed from the citation published in the reference list.

Analytic methods (code) and materials storage and documentation
The policy of Evolution is to publish papers in which authors make their empirical raw data and analytic methods available to other researchers for the purposes of reproducing the results or replicating the procedure. Authors must specify where that material is available in their data availability statement. There are several generalist data repositories where you may wish to consider archiving your data. Most of these can also host R objects and R scripts.

Dryad
Zenodo (can be integrated with a Dryad dataset)
Figshare
GitHub
Open Science Framework
For R packages (which can include R objects, scripts, and documentation), repositories such as CRAN, BioConductor, and GitHub are often used.

This journal follows Springer Nature research data policy. Sharing of all relevant research data is strongly encouraged and authors must add a Data Availability Statement to original research articles.

Research data includes a wide range of types, including spreadsheets, images, textual extracts, archival documents, video or audio, interview notes or any specialist formats generated during research.

Data availability statements
All original research must include a data availability statement. This statement should explain how to access data supporting the results and analysis in the article, including links/citations to publicly archived datasets analysed or generated during the study. Please see our full policy here.

If it is not possible to share research data publicly, for instance when individual privacy could be compromised, this statement should describe how data can be accessed and any conditions for reuse. Participant consent should be obtained and documented prior to data collection. See our guidance on sensitive data for more information.

When creating a data availability statement, authors are encouraged to consider the minimal dataset that would be necessary to interpret, replicate and build upon the findings reported in the article.",4,https://www.springer.com/journal/10452/submission-guidelines#Instructions%20for%20Authors_Research%20Data%20Policy%20and%20Data%20Availability%20Statements,,Not Expected At All,Encouraged,"Data transparency

Submission of a manuscript to Management of Biological Invasions implies that all scientific information described in the manuscript, including all relevant raw experimental and field data, will be freely available online for any interested data user. We expect users of the data to cite the published paper. Geo-referenced species record information (both for non-native and native species), annotated checklists and biological profiles of non-native species should be deposited in the Regional Euro-Asian Biological Invasions Centre (REABIC) information system (please check standard submission forms in the Manuscript presentation section of the Author Guidelines) or in the other recognized online species record data repository (e.g. GBIF or one of its data sources). Please note that REABIC is a partner organisation and data provider for the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF) (REABIC profile at the GBIF web site) and for the European Alien Species Information Network (EASIN). All data deposited to REABIC will be publically available only after release of the relevant publication in Management of Biological Invasions, including relevant publication of species checklists or species occurrences with GBIF. All of these data or selected parts of them can be published in tabular format or as supplementary material as part of the online research paper without any size limit and without page charges. Relevant links and references will be included with deposited data in order to protect authorsâ rights on this information and to increase the citability of their publication in Management of Biological Invasions.
 

Nucleic acid sequences also should be deposited in an appropriate database (i.e. GenBank) in time for the accession number to be included in the published article.

Elsevier collaborates with a number of repositories to link articles on ScienceDirect with relevant repositories, giving readers access to underlying data that gives them a better understanding of the research described.
There are different ways to link your datasets to your article. When available, you can directly link your dataset to your article by providing the relevant information in the submission system. For more information, visit the database linking page.

For supported data repositories a repository banner will automatically appear next to your published article on ScienceDirect.

In addition, you can link to relevant data or entities through identifiers within the text of your manuscript, using the following format: Database: xxxx (e.g., TAIR: AT1G01020; CCDC: 734053; PDB: 1XFN).",During Peer Review,Encouraged,"""To facilitate reproducibility and data reuse, this journal also encourages you to share your software, code, models, algorithms, protocols, methods and other useful materials related to the project.""

We recognise it is not always possible to share research data publicly, for instance when individual privacy could be compromised, and in such instances data availability should still be stated in the manuscript along with any conditions for access.

Data availability statements can take one of the following forms (or a combination of more than one if required for multiple datasets):

    The Journal of Fish and Wildlife Management requires, as a condition for publication, that data supporting the results in papers published be provided either directly in the paper, in the associated supplemental materials (electronic files that provide information associated with a paper; Internet links to these files are given in the published paper), or archived in an appropriate public archive. Data are important products of the scientific enterprise, and they should be preserved and usable for decades in the future. Exceptions, especially for sensitive information such as human subject data or the location of endangered species, and short-term embargoes, may be granted at the discretion of the Editor-In-Chief.

In order to comply with our policy, manuscripts submitted to JFWM and NAF require completion of a Data Access field during the submission process that confirms all the raw data required to replicate their results are included using one or more of the following methods:

    (1) directly in the manuscript;
    (2) in supplemental material files uploaded with the submission along with captions in a Supplemental Material section of the manuscript itself;
    (3) previously exempted from this requirement by the Editor-In-Chief (exemptions are rare and typically cover narrowly defined subsets of data, such as specific locations for species of conservation concern or personal information from survey respondents).

If your manuscript is accepted for publication, the raw data may ultimately reside in appropriate publicly available archives (e.g., DRYAD or ScienceBase) with file captions published in an Archived Material instead of Supplemental Material section. However, even if you plan to use that approach, the data and captions need to be provided in a Supplemental Material section for the purposes of peer review. Once approved, authors can work with the Editor-In-Chief to determine if they will remain as Supplemental Material, be published as Archived Material, or a combination thereof.",5,https://meridian.allenpress.com/fwspubs/pages/Guide-for-Authors#DataArchiving,,Not Expected At All,Not Mentioned,,NA,,Could  not find any mentions regarding code

10/20/2023 2:39:07,[redacted],[redacted],neobiota,Unclear,Encouraged,"Data Publishing Guidelines
We strongly encourage and support various strategies and methods for data publication. The preferable way is to store data in internationally recognised data repositories and link back to the data set(s) in the respective article. Data can also be published as supplementary files to the articles, however this should be an exception rather than a rule (see How to publish data). The key to discover, use and cite your data is to include the data references in the reference lists of the articles and always include the DOIs of the data sets, when available, in the citation record. You may read more about this in How to cite data section of the article below. A good example of concise data citation guidelines using DOIs is also available on the GBIF website and on other data repositories.

Darwin Core-structured species occurrence records and observations (primary biodiversity data) should be published with GBIF using either the Integrated Publishing Toolkit (IPT) (for which Pensoft maintains an instance, in case such is not available to the authors).  Alternatively, DwC data could also be published in trusted and community-recognised repositories (for example, Atlas of Living Australia, Symbiota,  Arctos or others), however deposition at GBIF should always have a priority over the alternatives. In case a dataset is deposited in more than one repository, the data paper should link to the dataset which is actually described, again with GBIF having a priority over the others.

Authors who want to publish species occurrence data as supplementary files only or through generic repositories (e.g. Zenodo, Dryad), instead of submitting these to GBIF, should justify their decision to do so in a letter to the editors.

For biodiversity and biodiversity-related data the reader may consult the Strategies and guidelines for scholarly publishing of biodiversity data (Penev et al. 2017, Research Ideas and Outcomes 3: e12431. https://doi.org/10.3897/rio.3.e12431).

Open data publishing and sharing

Pensoft and ARPHA encourage open data publication and sharing, in accordance with Pantonâs Principles and FAIR Data Principles. For the domain of biodiversity-related publications Pensoft has specially developed extended Data Publishing Policies and Guidelines for Biodiversity Data. Specific data publishing guidelines are available on the journal website. 

Data can be published in various ways, such as preservation in data repositories linked to the respective article or as data files or packages supplementary to the article. Datasets should be deposited in an appropriate, trusted repository and the associated identifier (URL or DOI) of the dataset(s) must be included in the data resources section of the article. Reference(s) to datasets should also be included in the reference list of the article with DOIs (where available). Where no discipline-specific data repository exists authors should deposit their datasets in a general repository such as, for example Zenodo or others.

Providing large datasets in supplementary information is strongly discouraged and the preferred approach is to make data available in repositories.  Scientific Data, a Nature Portfolio journal, maintains a list of approved and recommended data repositories to support researchers seeking suitable repositories for their data. Please refer to our authorship policy for information about authorsâ responsibilities for preserving and making available data, code and materials upon publication.  Authors are responsible for obtaining all necessary permissions and ensuring compliance with local regulatory requirements for data sharing.

Mandatory deposition of data is required for certain data types; see table below with recommended repositories.  Supporting data must be made available to editors and peer reviewers where requested at the time of submission for the purposes of evaluating the manuscript. Any restrictions on sharing must be discussed with the editor at submission who reserves the right to decline the study if these conditions are found to be unduly prohibitive. 

Nature Portfolio journals' data availability policies are compatible with the standardised research data policies set out by Springer Nature. Authors who need help understanding our data sharing policies, finding a suitable data repository, or organising and sharing research data can access our Author Support portal for additional guidance.

Reporting standards and availability of data, materials, code and protocols
An inherent principle of publication is that others should be able to replicate and build upon the authors' published claims. A condition of publication in a Nature Portfolio journal is that authors are required to make materials, data, code, and associated protocols promptly available to readers without undue qualifications. Any restrictions on the availability of materials or information must be disclosed to the editors at the time of submission. Any restrictions must also be disclosed in the submitted manuscript.

After publication, readers who encounter refusal by the authors to comply with these policies should contact the chief editor of the journal. In cases where editors are unable to resolve a complaint, the journal may refer the matter to the authors' funding institution and/or publish a formal statement of correction, attached online to the publication, stating that readers have been unable to obtain necessary materials to replicate the findings.

Reporting requirements
Nature Portfolio journals aim to improve the transparency of reporting and reproducibility of published results across all areas of science. Before peer review, the corresponding author must complete an editorial policy checklist to ensure compliance with Nature Portfolio editorial policies; where relevant, manuscripts sent for review must include completed reporting summary documents

Authors must make available upon request, to editors and reviewers, any previously unreported custom computer code or algorithm used to generate results that are reported in the paper and central to its main claims. Any reason that would preclude the need for code or algorithm sharing will be evaluated by the editors who reserve the right to decline the paper if important code is unavailable.

For all studies using custom code or mathematical algorithm that is deemed central to the conclusions, a statement must be included under the heading ""Code availability"", indicating whether and how the code or algorithm can be accessed, including any restrictions to access. Code availability statements should be provided as a separate section after the data availability statement but before the references.

Upon publication, Nature Portfolio journals consider it best practice to release custom computer code in a way that allows readers to repeat the published results.

This journal requests and enables you to share data that supports your research publication where appropriate, and enables you to interlink the data with your published articles. Research data refers to the results of observations or experimentation that validate research findings. To facilitate reproducibility and data reuse, this journal also encourages you to share your software, code, models, algorithms, protocols, methods and other useful materials related to the project.
Below are a number of ways in which you can associate data with your article or make a statement about the availability of your data when submitting your manuscript. If you are sharing data in one of these ways, you are encouraged to cite the data in your manuscript and reference list. Please refer to the ""References"" section for more information about data citation. For more information on depositing, sharing and using research data and other relevant research materials, visit the research data page.

Data linking
If you have made your research data available in a data repository, you can link your article directly to the dataset. Elsevier collaborates with a number of repositories to link articles on ScienceDirect with relevant repositories, giving readers access to underlying data that gives them a better understanding of the research described.
There are different ways to link your datasets to your article. When available, you can directly link your dataset to your article by providing the relevant information in the submission system. For more information, visit the database linking page.

For supported data repositories a repository banner will automatically appear next to your published article on ScienceDirect.

In addition, you can link to relevant data or entities through identifiers within the text of your manuscript, using the following format: Database: xxxx (e.g., TAIR: AT1G01020; CCDC: 734053; PDB: 1XFN).

Research Elements

This journal enables you to publish research objects related to your original research â such as data, methods, protocols, software and hardware â as an additional paper in a Research Elements journal.
Research Elements is a suite of peer-reviewed, open access journals which make your research objects findable, accessible and reusable. Articles place research objects into context by providing detailed descriptions of objects and their application, and linking to the associated original research articles. Research Elements articles can be prepared by you, or by one of your collaborators.

During submission, you will be alerted to the opportunity to prepare and submit a manuscript to one of the Research Elements journals.

Molecular Ecology Resources requires, as a condition for publication, that the data supporting the results in the paper will be archived in an appropriate public repository. Essential metadata such as spatio-temporal data should be archived and linked to associated genetic data when organisms have been collected from natural, wild, or domesticated populations (for example, spatio-temporal data may not be relevant for laboratory strains or some experimental systems). Whenever possible the scripts and other artefacts used to generate the analyses presented in the paper should also be publicly archived. Embargos may be granted in exceptional instances at the discretion of the Editor, such as for human subject data, the location of endangered species, or long-term ecological data sets.

We require that authors include a âData Accessibility and Benefit-Sharingâ section after the References (see 'Preparing the Submission' Section for details). This section must be present at initial submission, and data archiving must be completed before final acceptance. Alongside this, we ask that authors also cite their data according to the Force 11 Data Citation Principles.

The American Journal of Biological Anthropology recognizes the many benefits of archiving research data. The American Journal of Biological Anthropology expects you to archive all the data from which your published results are derived in a public repository. The repository that you choose should offer you guaranteed preservation (see the registry of research data repositories at https://www.re3data.org/) and should help you make it findable, accessible, interoperable, and re-useable, according to FAIR Data Principles (https://www.force11.org/group/fairgroup/fairprinciples). 

All accepted manuscripts are required to publish a data availability statement to confirm the presence or absence of shared data. If you have shared data, this statement will describe how the data can be accessed, and include a persistent identifier (e.g., a DOI for the data, or an accession number) from the repository where you shared the data. Authors will be required to confirm adherence to the policy. If you cannot share the data described in your manuscript, for example for legal or ethical reasons, or do not intend to share the data then you must provide the appropriate data availability statement. The American Journal of Biological Anthropology notes that FAIR data sharing allows for access to shared data under restrictions (e.g., to protect confidential or proprietary information) but notes that the FAIR principles encourage you to share data in ways that are as open as possible (but that can be as closed as necessary).

For all journals, BMC strongly encourages that all datasets on which the conclusions of the paper rely should be available to readers, and where there is a community established norm for data sharing, BMC mandates data deposition (for data types with required deposition, see below). 

We encourage authors to ensure that their datasets are either deposited in publicly available repositories (where available and appropriate) or presented in the main manuscript or additional supporting files, in machine-readable format (such as spreadsheets rather than PDFs) whenever possible. Please see the Data repository guidance page for further information. For several journals, deposition of the data on which the conclusions of the manuscript rely is required. Please check the individual journalâs Submission Guidelines for more information.

Authors who need help understanding our data sharing policies, finding a suitable data repository, or organising and sharing research data can access our Author Support portal for additional guidance.

Mandated data deposition based on community-established norms
For certain data types (for example genomic data, nucleic acid or protein sequences), BMC mandates data deposition in a public access repository upon submission as there is a community-accepted standard of data deposition and data sharing. 

Please consult this list of mandated data types, ensuring any relevant data are deposited in an appropriate repository and linked from your manuscript.

Research data includes a wide range of types, including spreadsheets, images, textual extracts, archival documents, video or audio, interview notes or any specialist formats generated during research.

Data availability statements
All original research must include a data availability statement. This statement should explain how to access data supporting the results and analysis in the article, including links/citations to publicly archived datasets analysed or generated during the study. Please see our full policy here.

If it is not possible to share research data publicly, for instance when individual privacy could be compromised, this statement should describe how data can be accessed and any conditions for reuse. Participant consent should be obtained and documented prior to data collection. See our guidance on sensitive data for more information.

Submission of a manuscript to Aquatic Invasions implies that all scientific information described in the manuscript, including all relevant raw experimental and field data, will be freely available online for any interested data user. We expect users of the data to cite the published paper. Geo-referenced species record information (both for non-native and native species), annotated checklists and biological profiles of non-native species should be deposited in the Regional Euro-Asian Biological Invasions Centre (REABIC) information system (please check standard submission forms in the Manuscript presentation section of the Author Guidelines) or in the other recognized online species record data repository (e.g. GBIF or one of its data sources). Please note that REABIC is a partner organisation and data provider for the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF) (REABIC profile at the GBIF web site) and for the European Alien Species Information Network (EASIN). All data deposited to REABIC will be publically available only after release of the relevant publication in Aquatic Invasions, including relevant publication of species checklists or species occurrences with GBIF. All of these data or selected parts of them can be published in tabular format or as supplementary material as part of the online research paper without any size limit and without page charges. Relevant links and references will be included with deposited data in order to protect authorsâ rights on this information and to increase the citability of their publication in Aquatic Invasions.
 

Nucleic acid sequences also should be deposited in an appropriate database (i.e. GenBank) in time for the accession number to be included in the published article.

Data can be qualitative or quantitative, collected via physical measurements, surveys, interviews, observations, or other forms of data collection. When we ask for data availability, we do not refer to raw data, but data that is anonymized to protect study participants.

Code refers to computer code of computer models as well as scripts for (statistical) data analysis. The reason for this is to improve the quality of the manuscripts and facilitate the increasing requests from research funders to share and archive research data and code. As part of the submission of the manuscript, the data and code must be made available to editors and peer reviewers for the purposes of evaluating the manuscript by providing a code and data availability statement. Upon acceptance of the paper and as part of the publication, the authors provide a data and code availability statement, which specifies that the data and code are deposited publicly and lists the name(s) of archives along with digital object identifiers or URLs for the relevant deposits.

11/03/2023 18:38,[redacted],[redacted],ecology letters,During Peer Review,Mandated,"Data and code are important products of scientific enterprise, and they must be preserved and remain accessible in future decades.

For manuscripts that depend on new or existing data, and/or on code written by the authors, Ecology Letters requires that this material be supplied and accessible to editors and reviewers at the time of submission. This means that prior to submission, you will need to prepare your raw data (or the subset of existing data that was used), metadata, code and derived data products, archive this material in an external repository that subject editors and reviewers can access, and include a clear README file that will ensure accessibility and readability. This will allow us to properly assess your work and confirm that the archive is complete and usable. See below for more details on the requirements.

Ecology Letters requires that the raw data (or subset of existing data) used to generate the results in the paper are archived in one of the following public repositories: Dryad, Figshare, Hal, Zenodo, OSF, US federal agencies repositories, or Environmental Data Initiative (EDI). Data should not be uploaded alongside your submission as a supporting document. In order to ensure data can be reusable, it is necessary to upload (1) the data files that were analysed to produce the statistics and figures reported in the paper, (2) a metadata file explaining what the data are in each column and what rows represent. The metadata should record the units of measurement and a verbal description in English of the data included in each column. Dryad also publishes a list of best practices (https://datadryad.org/stash/best_practices) that Ecology Letters endorses.

Computer code used to produce the figures and conduct analyses or simulations must also be archived in a public repository (e.g., Zenodo, Figshare). Code should not be uploaded with your submission as a supporting document. All code must be annotated so readers can understand what each segment or function does. If figures have been generated in a program such as Excel, the Excel file including the figure and the data must be archived. Further guidance is available at https://authorservices.wiley.com/author-resources/Journal-Authors/open-access/data-sharing-citation/index.html. 

If the raw data used for a study are already deposited online in a different repository (excluding business-owned and single-university repositories) with a separate DOI, this can be cited. However, often data sources used from an already published dataset are quite different than the original, using different subsets of the data and manipulating it in different ways. In such cases, we request that authors of Ecology Letters papers follow best practices for open science and provide code (preferably in R) that is able to access the cited DOI, retrieve the raw data used for the study, and manipulate it into the form used for analyses. This data accessing code must be combined with the code used for analyses, and deposited in the same repository.

DNA sequences published in Ecology Letters must be deposited in the EMBL/GenBank/DDJB Nucleotide Sequence Databases. An accession number for each sequence must be included in the manuscript.

Exceptions may be granted at the discretion of the Editor-in-Chief for sensitive information such as human subject data or the location of endangered species. An embargo of up to one year is permitted. Requests for longer periods will be rejected. At the time of submission, authors must use the private-for-peer-review option provided by data repositories.

Authors are required to complete a data accessibility statement for all papers, confirming that each of these actions has been undertaken. The statement, as well as data and code DOI, must be provided at initial submission. Editors will screen some of the data submitted. If at a later date it is found that authors of published papers have not adhered to these strict guidelines, the paper will be retracted by the editors and a statement made in the journal justifying this action.

Purpose and General Principles
To maintain high standards of research reproducibility, and to promote the reuse of new findings, eLife requires all data associated with an article to be made freely and widely available. These must be in the most useful formats and according to the relevant reporting standards, unless there are compelling legal or ethical reasons to restrict access. The provision of data should comply with FAIR principles (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable).

Specifically, authors must make all original data used to support the claims of the paper, or that is required to reproduce them, available in the manuscript text, tables, figures or supplementary materials, or at a trusted digital repository (the latter is recommended). This must include all variables, treatment conditions, and observations described in the manuscript. The authors must also provide a full account of the materials and procedures used to collect, preâprocess, clean, generate and analyze the data that would enable it to be independently reproduced by other researchers. The authors must ensure the provenance of the data for at least a 10 year period.

This document details and illuminates this policy, and addresses several common issues we have encountered with data availability in the past, so that authors can avoid them in the future.

This journal follows Springer Nature research data policy. Sharing of all relevant research data is strongly encouraged and authors must add a Data Availability Statement to original research articles.

Research data includes a wide range of types, including spreadsheets, images, textual extracts, archival documents, video or audio, interview notes or any specialist formats generated during research.

Data availability statements
All original research must include a data availability statement. This statement should explain how to access data supporting the results and analysis in the article, including links/citations to publicly archived datasets analysed or generated during the study. Please see our full policy here.

If it is not possible to share research data publicly, for instance when individual privacy could be compromised, this statement should describe how data can be accessed and any conditions for reuse. Participant consent should be obtained and documented prior to data collection. See our guidance on sensitive data for more information.

When creating a data availability statement, authors are encouraged to consider the minimal dataset that would be necessary to interpret, replicate and build upon the findings reported in the article.

Further guidance on writing a data availability statement, including examples, is available at:

Data availability statements

Data repositories
Authors are strongly encouraged to deposit their supporting data in a publicly available repository. Sharing your data in a repository promotes the integrity, discovery and reuse of your research, making it easier for the research community to build on and credit your work.

See our data repository guidance for information on finding a suitable repository.

We recommend the use of discipline-specific repositories where available. For a number of data types, submission to specific public repositories is mandatory.

See our list of mandated data types.

The journal encourages making research data available under open licences that permit reuse. The journal does not enforce use of particular licences in third party repositories.

Data Availability and Policy

The ISME Journal adheres to Springer Natureâs Data Policy Type 3. This means that a submission to The ISME Journal implies that materials described in the manuscript, including all relevant raw data, will be freely available to any researcher wishing to use them for non-commercial purposes, without breaching participant confidentiality. It also means that a Data Availability Statement (see below for more details) is required by the journal.
Data Policy Details

The journal strongly encourages that all datasets on which the conclusions of the paper rely should be available to readers. We encourage authors to ensure that their datasets are either deposited in publicly available repositories (where available and appropriate) or presented in the main manuscript or additional supporting files whenever possible. Please see Springer Natureâs information on recommended repositories.

*For the following types of data set, submission to a community-endorsed, public repository is mandatory:

[it's a big table that is hard to paste but the list is: Protein sequences, DNA and RNA sequences, DNA and RNA sequencing data, Genetic polymorphisms, Linked genotype and phenotype data, Macromolecular structure, Microarray data (must be MIAME compliant), Crystallographic data for small molecules]",2,https://www.nature.com/ismej/authors-and-referees/data-availability-and-policy,"I've put during peer review is the first availability because a data availability statement is required in the submitted MS which sort of implies this but technically not neccessarily? Also I find this statement a little unclear since it says submission to the journal implies that the data will be available but then references Springer Natureâs Data Policy Type 3 which says 'encourages'. Some specific data types are mandated though if you scroll down the page (reproduce above). There are acceptable repositories listed as well.

The Nordic Society Oikos mandates authors to make freely available any data used in their publication. When re-using datasets, these should be cited in the reference list.
DATA AVAILABILITY

NSO journals mandates authors to make all data and related metadata underlying the findings described in their manuscript fully available in a public, permanent repository. Repositories may be either subject-specific (where these exist) and accept specific types of structured data, or generalist repositories that accept multiple data types, such as e.g, Dryad. At submission, the author will be asked to specify where the data are planned to be deposited. Exceptions to the data archiving policy will normally not be considered, except for data relating to e.g. sensitive species. Authors can themselves chose to embargo their data for up to 12 months, if the chosen repository allows this (the data will still have to be uploaded upon manuscript acceptance).

If authors did not collect data themselves, but used another source, this source should be cited in the reference list. Authors who have questions or difficulties with the policy, or readers who have difficulty accessing data, are encouraged to contact the Managing Editor.

Unacceptable data access restrictions
NSO journals will not consider manuscripts for which the following factors influence the ability to share data:

    The conclusions depend solely on the analysis of proprietary data (e.g. data owned by commercial interests, or copyrighted data). If proprietary data are used, the manuscript must include an analysis of public data that validates the conclusions so that others can reproduce the analysis and build on the findings.

Explanatory notes and guidance

    Definition of data that is strongly encouraged to be shared. The NSO defines the âminimal datasetâ to consist of the dataset used to reach the conclusions drawn in the manuscript with related metadata and methods, and any additional data required to replicate the reported study findings in their entirety. Core descriptive data, methods, and study results should be included within the main paper, regardless of data deposition. Editors and reviewers may require particular data types for certain articles on a case-by-case basis. Authors who have datasets too large for sharing via repositories or uploaded files should contact the relevant journal for advice.
    Guidance on data repositories. The NSO encourages that authors comply with field-specific standards for preparation and recording of data and select repositories appropriate to their field, for example deposition of microarray data in ArrayExpress or GEO; deposition of gene sequences in GenBank, EMBL or Dryad. Authors are encouraged to select repositories that meet accepted criteria as trustworthy digital repositories, such as criteria of the Centre for Research Libraries or Data Seal of Approval. Large, international databases are more likely to persist than small, local ones. Authors should not use repositories with licensing policies that are more restrictive than CC-BY.

An open research policy provides full transparency for scientific data and code, facilitates replication and synthesis, and aligns ESA journals with current standards. As of 1 February 2021, all new manuscript submissions to ESA journals must abide by the following policy.

As a condition for publication in ESA journals, all underlying data and novel statistical code pertinent to the results presented in the publication must be made available in a permanent, publicly accessible data archive or repository upon acceptance of a manuscript, with rare exceptions (see the Details tab for more information). Archived data and novel statistical code should be sufficiently complete to allow replication of tables, graphs, and statistical analyses reported in the original publication, and perform new or meta-analyses. As such, the desire of authors to control additional research with these data and/or code shall not be grounds for withholding material.

Thus, for the purpose of this policy, the following underlying material is required:

Raw data and metadata used to generate tables, figures, plots, videos/animations
Novel code or computer software utilized to generate results or analyses
All methods or protocols utilized to generate the data, both existing (including references) and new methods/protocols
Derived data products

Novel code is any code that cannot be directly cited and falls under two categories:

A function or package you have created yourself
A function or package you have edited to the extent that you cant simply cite an existing function or package
We require a version of record (the exact version described in the paper that allows a reader to replicate the results presented) provided in the native format of the code file.

This material must be provided in an external repository during the peer review process. We strongly encourage using a repository with a private-for-peer review option, but a public repository posting is also acceptable. If the manuscript is accepted, we require publication of the code in an external repository that permits future updates with versioning control. Novel code in an outside repository must also be properly cited and referenced in the final publication. Code that is not novel (e.g., from a standard statistical package or publicly available model) must be properly cited and referenced.

If your code is not novel, please state this clearly in your Open Research statement. If your statement is ambiguous, the journals editorial staff will contact you for further details.",4,https://www.esa.org/publications/data-policy/,

Data Archiving

Data are important products of the scientific enterprise, and they should be preserved and usable for decades in the future. The British Ecological Society thus requires, as a condition for publication, that all data supporting the results in papers published in its journals are archived in an appropriate public archive offering open access and guaranteed preservation. For theoretical papers the underlying model code must be archived.

The data underlying all the results presented in the paper must be archived in a format that allows a third party to interpret the data. The archived data must allow each result in the published paper to be recreated and the analyses reported in the paper to be replicated in full to support the conclusions made. Authors are welcome to archive more than this, but not less.

Authors may elect to have the data made publicly available at time of publication or, if the technology of the archive allows, may opt to embargo access to the data for a period of up to a year after publication. Exceptions, including longer embargoes, may be granted only in exceptional circumstances at the discretion of the editor, especially for sensitive information such as confidential social data or the location of endangered species.

List of Repositories

Research Data Policy

General repositories - for all types of research data - such as figshare and Dryad may be used where appropriate.

Datasets that are assigned digital object identifiers (DOIs) by a data repository may be cited in the reference list. Data citations should include the minimum information recommended by DataCite: authors, title, publisher (repository name), identifier.

DataCite

Where a widely established research community expectation for data archiving in public repositories exists, submission to a community-endorsed, public repository is mandatory. Persistent identifiers (such as DOIs and accession numbers) for relevant datasets must be provided in the paper.

If the journal that youre submitting to uses double-blind peer review and you are providing reviewers with access to your data (for example via a repository link, supplementary information or data on request), it is strongly suggested that the authorship in the data is also blinded. There are data repositories that can assist with this and/or will create a link to mask the authorship of your data.",3,https://www.springer.com/journal/360/submission-guidelines#Instructions%20for%20Authors_Research%20Data%20Policy%20and%20Data%20Availability%20Statements; https://www.springernature.com/gp/authors/research-data-policy/research-data-policy-types,Mandatory archiving for some types,Not Expected At All,Not Mentioned,"Data transparency

Data are important products of the scientific enterprise, and they should be preserved and usable for decades in the future. The British Ecological Society thus requires, as a condition for publication, that all data supporting the results in papers published in its journals are archived in an appropriate public archive offering open access and guaranteed preservation. For theoretical papers the underlying model code must be archived.

The data underlying all the results presented in the paper must be archived in a format that allows a third party to interpret the data. The archived data must allow each result in the published paper to be recreated and the analyses reported in the paper to be replicated in full to support the conclusions made. Authors are welcome to archive more than this, but not less.

Authors may elect to have the data made publicly available at time of publication or, if the technology of the archive allows, may opt to embargo access to the data for a period of up to a year after publication. Exceptions, including longer embargoes, may be granted only in exceptional circumstances at the discretion of the editor, especially for sensitive information such as confidential social data or the location of endangered species.

This policy applies to submissions that include scripts for novel analyses, new methodologies, and for simulations. We do not require authors to make code available when used for standard analyses, creating figures or anything that does not affect the reproducibility of the results.

For submissions where code is the main research output please adhere to Methods in Ecology and Evolutions policy.

All authors are required to make code for simulations, new applications and non-standard analyses freely available upon acceptance so that analyses are reproducible (see below).

The overarching objective of our policy is to ensure that high quality code is readily available to our readers, ideally open source.

To facilitate data sharing, JEB has integrated its submission system with Dryad data deposition. Authors submitting their research to JEB will have the opportunity to deposit their data directly into the Dryad archive and will receive a permanent, citable link to their dataset. Deposition in Dryad ensures the data are freely accessible once the article becomes available online, and provides bidirectional links between the article and the data, increasing visibility for both. We encourage authors to submit data at the time of manuscript submission and to provide confidential access for the editors and referees. Datasets deposited in Dryad during submission will be released once the article has been accepted for publication.

In 2011 we implemented a data archiving policy that applies to all papers published in JFWM. The policy has also been implemented by NAF. The policy was formally introduced for JFWM in the editorial for Issue 2, Number 1 published in June 2011, but now applies to NAF as well. See our 2011 JFWM Editorial for more details, which reads, in part:

The Journal of Fish and Wildlife Management requires, as a condition for publication, that data supporting the results in papers published be provided either directly in the paper, in the associated supplemental materials (electronic files that provide information associated with a paper; Internet links to these files are given in the published paper), or archived in an appropriate public archive. Data are important products of the scientific enterprise, and they should be preserved and usable for decades in the future. Exceptions, especially for sensitive information such as human subject data or the location of endangered species, and short-term embargoes, may be granted at the discretion of the Editor-In-Chief.

In order to comply with our policy, manuscripts submitted to JFWM and NAF require completion of a Data Access field during the submission process that confirms all the raw data required to replicate their results are included using one or more of the following methods:

(1) directly in the manuscript;
(2) in supplemental material files uploaded with the submission along with captions in a Supplemental Material section of the manuscript itself;
(3) previously exempted from this requirement by the Editor-In-Chief (exemptions are rare and typically cover narrowly defined subsets of data, such as specific locations for species of conservation concern or personal information from survey respondents).

If your manuscript is accepted for publication, the raw data may ultimately reside in appropriate publicly available archives (e.g., DRYAD or ScienceBase) with file captions published in an Archived Material instead of Supplemental Material section. However, even if you plan to use that approach, the data and captions need to be provided in a Supplemental Material section for the purposes of peer review. Once approved, authors can work with the Editor-In-Chief to determine if they will remain as Supplemental Material, be published as Archived Material, or a combination thereof.

It is not acceptable to state that data ""will be provided upon acceptance"" - these manuscripts will be returned without review. You will be asked to provide details on the raw data used in your study AND specifically how they are being provided for review. Please be specific; complicated data sets may require extensive text. Please provide enough detail so a reader with no previous knowledge of your study can grasp the nature of all the raw data used and quickly confirm that they have been provided as required above.

Repositories may be either subject-specific (where these exist) and accept specific types of structured data, or generalist repositories that accept multiple data types, such as e.g, Dryad. At submission, the author will be asked to specify where the data are planned to be deposited. Exceptions to the data archiving policy will normally not be considered, except for data relating to e.g. sensitive species. Authors can themselves chose to embargo their data for up to 12 months, if the chosen repository allows this (the data will still have to be uploaded upon manuscript acceptance).

If authors did not collect data themselves, but used another source, this source should be cited in the reference list. Authors who have questions or difficulties with the policy, or readers who have difficulty accessing data, are encouraged to contact the Managing Editor.",5,https://nordicsocietyoikos.org/publishing-policy,,Not Expected At All,Not Mentioned,N/A,NA,https://nordicsocietyoikos.org/publishing-policy,Code or script not mentioned anywhere in the journal's policies

Sharing of all relevant research data is strongly encouraged and authors must add a Data Availability Statement to original research articles.

Research data includes a wide range of types, including spreadsheets, images, textual extracts, archival documents, video or audio, interview notes or any specialist formats generated during research.

Data availability statements
All original research must include a data availability statement. This statement should explain how to access data supporting the results and analysis in the article, including links/citations to publicly archived datasets analysed or generated during the study. Please see our full policy here (https://www.springernature.com/gp/authors/research-data-policy).

If it is not possible to share research data publicly, for instance when individual privacy could be compromised, this statement should describe how data can be accessed and any conditions for reuse. Participant consent should be obtained and documented prior to data collection. See our guidance on sensitive data for more information.

When creating a data availability statement, authors are encouraged to consider the minimal dataset that would be necessary to interpret, replicate and build upon the findings reported in the article.

1/21/2024 7:04:11,[redacted],[redacted],plos biology,After Acceptance (Post-Publication),Mandated,"PLOS journals require authors to make all data necessary to replicate their studys findings publicly available without restriction at the time of publication. When specific legal or ethical restrictions prohibit public sharing of a data set, authors must indicate how others may obtain access to the data.

When submitting a manuscript, authors must provide a Data Availability Statement describing compliance with PLOS' data policy. If the article is accepted for publication, the Data Availability Statement will be published as part of the article.

Acceptable data sharing methods are listed below, accompanied by guidance for authors as to what must be included in their Data Availability Statement and how to follow best practices in research reporting.

PLOS believes that sharing data fosters scientific progress. Data availability allows and facilitates:

Validation, replication, reanalysis, new analysis, reinterpretation or inclusion into meta-analyses;
Reproducibility of research;
Efforts to ensure data are archived, increasing the value of the investment made in funding scientific research;
Reduction of the burden on authors in preserving and finding old data, and managing data access requests;
Citation and linking of research data and their associated articles, enhancing visibility and ensuring recognition for authors, data producers and curators.
Publication is conditional on compliance with this policy. If restrictions on access to data come to light after publication, we reserve the right to post a Correction, an Editorial Expression of Concern, contact the authors' institutions and funders, or, in extreme cases, retract the publication.

PLOS strongly recommends sharing data in a repository whenever possible. Data repositories improve discoverability and accessibility, ensure long-term preservation, and lead to increased attention for the research.

PLOS journals highlight repository use with our Accessible Data icon, an experimental feature that appears on any research article with a link to selected repositories in its Data Availability Statement.
Minimal Data Set Definition
Authors must share the minimal data set for their submission. PLOS defines the minimal data set to consist of the data required to replicate all study findings reported in the article, as well as related metadata and methods. Additionally, PLOS requires that authors comply with field-specific standards for preparation, recording, and deposition of data when applicable.

...",5,https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/s/data-availability,,After Acceptance (Post-Publication),Encouraged,"Sharing Code
We expect all researchers with submissions to PLOS in which author-generated code underpins the findings in the manuscript to make all author-generated code available without restrictions upon publication of the work. In cases where code is central to the manuscript, we may require the code to be made available as a condition of publication. Authors are responsible for ensuring that the code is reusable and well documented.

Recommendations for sharing code
Authors are encouraged to share their code in a way that follows best practice and facilitates reproducibility and reuse. Authors are encouraged to:

Share their code via a repository that issues persistent identifiers, such as DOIs.
Clearly license their code using an open source license. 
Share clear documentation alongside the code that details any information needed to run the code, for example dependencies.
State how the code can be accessed in the Data Availability Statement of their manuscript. 
More information on best practice for sharing code can be found in the PLOS Biology author guidance.

If code cannot be shared due to legal or ethical reasons then authors should state this in the Data Availability Statement and give details of how to request access to the code. In cases where code can not be publicly shared, editors and reviewers reserve the right to access the code if deemed necessary for full assessment of the manuscript.",2,https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/s/materials-software-and-code-sharing,"The answer to ""How strict is this policy?"" should be ""unclear"""
1/21/2024 7:09:23,[redacted],[redacted],polar biology,During Peer Review,Encouraged,"Research Data Policy and Data Availability Statements
This journal follows Springer Nature research data policy. Sharing of all relevant research data is strongly encouraged and authors must add a Data Availability Statement to original research articles.

Research data includes a wide range of types, including spreadsheets, images, textual extracts, archival documents, video or audio, interview notes or any specialist formats generated during research.

Data availability statements
All original research must include a data availability statement. This statement should explain how to access data supporting the results and analysis in the article, including links/citations to publicly archived datasets analysed or generated during the study. Please see our full policy here.

If it is not possible to share research data publicly, for instance when individual privacy could be compromised, this statement should describe how data can be accessed and any conditions for reuse. Participant consent should be obtained and documented prior to data collection. See our guidance on sensitive data for more information.

When creating a data availability statement, authors are encouraged to consider the minimal dataset that would be necessary to interpret, replicate and build upon the findings reported in the article.

Further guidance on writing a data availability statement, including examples, is available at:
