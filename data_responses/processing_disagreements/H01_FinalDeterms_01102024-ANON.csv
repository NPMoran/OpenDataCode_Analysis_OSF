avian conservation and ecology,Society of Canadian Ornithologists and Birds Canada,No,"New Submission Process
To save time for everyone, the initial submission of your manuscript no longer needs to be formatted to any particular style. After answering some questions about your paper simply upload a double-spaced, line-numbered, anonymized pdf of your paper. Later, If your paper is accepted, you will be asked to upload a version that meets our journal’s specifications and formatting requirements.

(Note: re-submissions of manuscripts follow the procedures of the initial submission. If your initial submission required rich-text format files, those files will also be needed for re-submission.)

Initial Submission Guidelines
First, please ensure email from @ace-eco.org is not blocked by your email service provider and that the domain is marked as “not spam” in your email client. We must be able to communicate with you.

You will be guided through the initial submission process.

Step 1. Answer the questions provided.
Step 2. Enter authors’ names and details.
Step 3. Enter title, abstract, keywords, and acknowledgments details
Step 4. Upload a double-spaced, anonymized, and line-numbered pdf of your manuscript (include the title, abstract, graphs, tables, equations, literature cited, and appendices). The PDF will be sent directly to reviewers. Therefore, to ensure blind peer review, it is important that your names are not included in the PDF.
Step 5. Confirm and finalize your submission.
If you have any difficulties with this process, contact the managing editor by emailing managing_editor@ace-eco.org.

Post-Acceptance Guidelines for New, PDF-Only Submissions
After a paper is accepted, the corresponding author will be invited to upload all relevant files for their article for copy editing. The corresponding author should log in, navigate to the article, then go to the “Upload documents for copy editing” tab.

Step 1: Upload an .rtf file of your manuscript, from INTRODUCTION through to the end of LITERATURE CITED. This file should not include: embedded images, title, abstract, keywords, acknowledgments, tables, figures, or author information. Your upload should, however, include placeholders for any equations (e.g., “<eqn1>”).

Step 2: Upload attachments (tables, figure files, equations, and appendices) one by one by following the links and instructions on the page. For each attachment, add a caption in the field provided.

Step 3: Confirm that all files have been uploaded successfully and are presenting correctly by reviewing the html copyedit galley.

Step 4: Verify that you have completed the uploading of files by selecting “Submission upload complete.”",[redacted],[redacted],[redacted],Unclear,Partial (2/3),Not Expected At All,Not Mentioned,Full (3/3),Not Mentioned,Not Expected At All,Partial (2/3),Not Expected At All,Not Mentioned,Full (3/3),Not Mentioned
